SECTION_DESCRIPTION="The best years of life...", as they say of one's childhood. Years packed with energy and without too much care. In school and outside. How much of your imagination is shaped during these years? How much of what you read shapes your imagination? In an age of cell-phones, 40 character tweets, facebook and a myriad other things to do, a good book is still the choicest way to get into the minds of those brilliant story-tellers who can make you sit spell bound hours on end. And feel good about it afterwards. Here are some of the best works for children over the years.....
