At the time, no women were employed there as scientists. For the determined Dorothea Bate, however, this was the first step in an extraordinary career as a pioneering explorer and fossil-hunter as well as the beginning of a 50-year association with the Museum. A woman of immense charm, wit, and intelligence, Bate came to know many of the greatest archaeologists and paleontologists of the 20th century. Although internationally respected as a paleontologist during her lifetime, she was largely forgotten after her death. Now, drawing on letters, papers, and diaries, Karolyn Shindlers compelling biography rediscovers the life of a unique and indomitable woman.~2005-07-31~ekkitab~304~1350.00~1242.00~~INR~INDIA~INDIAN_EDITION~

The California Pizza Kitchen Cookbook Indian Edition~Flax, Larry & Rosenfield, Rick~9780028609881ek~hardcover~Ever since the first California Pizza Kitchen (CPK) was opened in Beverly Hills in 1985, founders Larry Flax and Rick Rosenfield have been inundated with requests for their creative pizza recipes. As Larry and Rick explain in the introduction, the recipe for their success is simple - take Americas favorite food cravings, like barbecued chicken, shrimp scampi, Peking duck, Thai satay, Southwestern burrito and BLT, and put them on a pizza. Until now, the official recipes were a secret. You could only get their California-style pizza at one of more than 80 CPK restaurants across the country, baked fresh in a wood-burning oven. The California Pizza Kitchen Cookbook includes all of your favorite pizza recipes, right off the menu, including the original BBQ Chicken Pizza, Thai Chicken Pizza, Shrimp Pesto Pizza, Santa Fe Chicken Pizza, and Mixed Grill Vegetarian Pizza. There are more than 25 delicious pizza recipes in all, plus an extra chapter with the creative CPK pastas, salads, soups and appetizers. And dont forget the dough - youll also find recipes for CPKs Basic Pizza Dough as well as honey-wheat pizza dough, with step-by-step instructions and photographs so even a beginner can master the techniques of tossing dough at home. The best thing about The California Pizza Kitchen Cookbook - maybe even better than their recipe for BBQ Chicken Pizza - is that founders Larry Flax and Rick Rosenfield are donating all of the royalties to charitable organizations across the country. Its their way of saying thanks to Americans for all of their support.~1995-12-31~ekkitab~112~660.00~607.20~~INR~INDIA~INDIAN_EDITION~

The California Pizza Kitchen Cookbook includes all of your favorite pizza recipes, right off the menu, including the original BBQ Chicken Pizza, Thai Chicken Pizza, Shrimp Pesto Pizza, Santa Fe Chicken Pizza, and Mixed Grill Vegetarian Pizza. There are more than 25 delicious pizza recipes in all, plus an extra chapter with the creative CPK pastas, salads, soups and appetizers. And dont forget the dough - youll also find recipes for CPKs Basic Pizza Dough as well as honey-wheat pizza dough, with step-by-step instructions and photographs so even a beginner can master the techniques of tossing dough at home. The best thing about The California Pizza Kitchen Cookbook - maybe even better than their recipe for BBQ Chicken Pizza - is that founders Larry Flax and Rick Rosenfield are donating all of the royalties to charitable organizations across the country. Its their way of saying thanks to Americans for all of their support.~1995-12-31~John Wiley & Sons~112~1100.00~1012.00~~USD~US~~

Stonewall Jackson: The Man, the Soldier, the Legend Indian Edition~Robertson, James I.~9780028646855ek~hardcover~The passage of 130 years has only deepened the fascination and reverence for Confederate general Thomas Jonathan "Stonewall" Jackson. He ranks today as among the half-dozen greatest soldiers that America has produced. Military academies in both hemispheres still teach his tactics. Revered by his men, respected by his foes, Jackson became seemingly invincible. When he learned of the generals fatal wound, Robert E. Lee sent his "affectionate regards", saying, "He has lost his left arm but I my right arm". Jacksons early death in 1863 was the greatest personal loss suffered by the Confederacy and one that permanently crippled the wartime South. This eagerly awaited biography is based on years of research into little-known manuscripts, unpublished letters, newspapers, and other primary sources. It offers for the first time a complete portrait - not only of Jackson the brilliant military strategist and beloved general but also of Jackson, the man of orphaned background, unyielding determination to conquer adversity, and deep religious convictions.~1997-02-28~ekkitab~1104~1470.00~1352.40~~INR~INDIA~INDIAN_EDITION~

Debra Ginsberg knew that her son, Blaze, was unique from the moment he was born in 1987.

Some of them, like Ginsberg and Burroughs, had achieved international fame, while others, like Gregory Corso, had not, and were coming to the realization that they might never receive the recognition they deserved. In his new role as student, secretary, and psychiatrist, Sam Kashner was caught up inthe hilarity of the hijinks and the cross fire of old arguments, finding , finding himself in hot tubs with Ginsberg and on field trips to the marijuana ranch cultivated by Burroughs and his ill-fated son, Billy.<P> Out of this rich material Kashner brings us a funny, touching, and irreverent portrait of the Beats never before seen: one that explodes the myths surrounding these American icons, but one that is also deeply felt and full of admiration.

Essential Dickinson Indian Edition~Dickinson, Emily~9780060887919ek~paperback~Emily Dickinson saw fewer than twenty of her 1,775 poems published during her lifetime: when she died in 1886, her obscurity as a poet was nearly total. Now widely recognized as one of the great American poets of the nineteenth century, she is one of a handful from any period whose enduring stature in the world of letters is matched by the loyal affection of generation after generation of readers. In this distinguished addition to The Essential Poets series, Joyce Carol Oates presents a "personal - yet not private" collection of Dickinson favorites, selecting from relatively obscure works as well as better-known poems to illuminate Dickinsons often unacknowledged range. Oates takes care to introduce us to the poets subversive playfulness; to her rebellious nature and radical aesthetic; to her gender-bending personae and surprisingly wicked humor. At the heart of this collection, of course, stands the work that made Dickinsons reputation as one of Americas great visionary poets: an artist who has written with stoic control and astonishing lucidity about the souls darkest, most terrifying hours.~2006-03-31~ekkitab~83~299.70~276.00~~INR~INDIA~INDIAN_EDITION~
