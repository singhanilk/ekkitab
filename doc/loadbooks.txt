This document describes how to initialize and load books into a fresh database.

1. Run db/create_ekkitab_db.sql. This is a sql script that can be run as follows.
   mysql -u <username> -p<password> < create_ekkitab_db.sql  
   Alternatively, you can enter mysql in an interactive mode and issue the following
   command: source create_ekkitab_db.sql

   This command initializes a fresh ekkitab database with all the tables required
   by Magento. There will not be any category information or book information.

2. Run db/create_reference_db.sql. Run the script in the same manner as you did 
   in step 1. 

   This command initializes a fresh reference database with all the tables required
   by the data loading scripts. 

3. Run data/ekkitab_categories.sql to initialize the system with the categories 
   we will have for the books. This is run in exactly the same way as we did 
   steps 1 and 2.

4. Run data/ekkitab_popular_tables.sql to initialize the system with the tables
   that will hold the popular items information.

5. Transfer the images to their correct final destination. The correct location is
   determined as follows:

   The base directory for images is: <magento_dir>/media/catalog/product/.

   In this base directory, images are stored under directory a/b where a is the first character
   of the image file and b is the second character of the image file. So for example,
   image file 1234567890.jpg should be saved into: <base_dir>/1/2, since 1 and 2 are the 
   first two characters of the image file.  

6. Run the script db/importbooks.php to import books from a data source into the
   reference database.

   Usage is: php importbooks.php <Source> <File> <Language> 
   where:

   <Source> is the source from which the data is obtained. For example: "Ingrams".
   <File> is the file that holds the book data in some pre specified format.
   <Language> is the language of the books described by the content.

   Each "Source" requires its own class file to parse the content. So, for example,
   source "Ingrams" will require the file Ingrams.php to be present in the 
   directory specified by IMPORTBOOKS_CLASSDIR in the confguration file importbooks_config.php.

   Make sure that you verify the contents of the _config.php file and the corresponding
   .ini file that it points to.

   In addition, there is a .ini file that describes the database connectivity. The location
   of this .ini file is also specified in the config file.

7. Run the script db/loadbooks.php to transfer eligible book content from the 
   reference database into the production database. This script also requires its associated
   config and .ini files.

8. Start the Magento Admininistration application and issue the Catalog URL Rewrite request
   from the Cache Management section.

ISSUES (so far):

1. create_ekkitab_db.sql thows an error on some machines complaining about the "USING BTREE" syntax.
2. we had to edit php.ini to set date.timezone = "Asia/Calcutta" to stop errors on use of default timezone.
