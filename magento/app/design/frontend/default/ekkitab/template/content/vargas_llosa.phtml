			<p><strong>Mario Vargas Llosa : "At first I thought, but what if this is a joke?"</strong><br><br>"I will try to survive the Nobel Prize," he joked during a news conference later on Thursday. "It was a total surprise." But he said the honour would not affect his craft. "I don't think the Nobel Prize will change my writing, my style, my themes," he said.<br><br>The Swedish Academy hailed his "cartography of structures of power" and "trenchant images of the individual's resistance, revolt, and defeat." in awarding him the world's biggest prize for literature.<br><br> The 74-year-old author has written more than 30 novels, plays and essays and he is the first South American winner of the prize since 1982 when it went to Colombian Gabriel Garcia Marquez.<br><br>Vargas Llosa is currently teaching at Princeton University.Born in the town of Arequipa, Vargas Llosa took Spanish nationality in 1993 - three years after an unsuccessful bid for the Peruvian presidency. The author had long been mentioned as a possible Nobel candidate - he has won some of the Western world's most prestigious literary medals including the Cervantes Prize in 1995 - the Spanish-speaking world's most distinguished literary honour. His works have also been translated into 31 languages, including Chinese, Hebrew and Arabic. <br/> <br/> <span class="quote">[Photo Credit: comunicacion-cultural.com]</span><br/><br>Find all Mario Vargas Llosa's books <a href="<?php echo $this->getUrl('ekkitab_catalog/search/index/author/Mario Vargas Llosa') ?>">in our Ekkitab collection.</a> and a sampler on this page. <br><br><iframe src="http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=<?php echo $this->getUrl('ekkitab_content/index/view/page/vargas_llosa.html')?>&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=false&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;colorscheme=light&amp;height=21" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border:none; overflow:hidden; width:240px; height:30px;" allowTransparency="true"></iframe></span>

In the author's native Peru, this powerful social satire so outraged the authorities that a thousand copies were publicly burned. The novel is set in Leoncio Prado Military Academy in Lima, where a group of cadets attempt to break out of the vicious round of sadistic ragging, military discipline, confinement and boredom. But their pranks set off a cycle of betrayal, murder and revenge which jeopardizes the entire military hierarchy. <br><br>'A work of undeniable power and skill.' Sunday Telegraph</div>

Don Anselmo, a stranger in a black coat, builds a brothel on the outskirts of the town while he charms its innocent people, setting in motion a chain reaction with extraordinary consequences. <br><br> This brothel, called the Green House, brings together the innocent and the corrupt: Bonificia, a young Indian girl saved by the nuns only to become a prostitute; Father Garcia, struggling for the church; and four best friends drawn to both excitement and escape.<br><br> The conflicting forces that haunt the Green House evoke a world balanced between savagery and civilization -- and one that is cursed by not being able to discern between the two. </div>

Odria. Over beers and a sea of freely spoken words, the conversation flows between two individuals, Santiago and Ambrosia, who talk of their tormented lives and of the overall degradation and frustration that has slowly taken over their town. <br><br> Through a complicated web of secrets and historical references, Mario Vargas Llosa analyzes the mental and moral mechanisms that govern power and the people behind it. More than a historic analysis, Conversation in The Cathedral is a groundbreaking novel that tackles identity as well as the role of a citizen and how a lack of personal freedom can forever scar a people and a nation. </div>
