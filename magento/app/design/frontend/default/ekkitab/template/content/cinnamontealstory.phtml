<p><strong><br>We were reminded of Robert Frost's “The road not taken” when we first came to know of CinnamonTeal. Located in idyllic Goa and catering to a niche clientèle, we thought: “Here is a company that is built on an ideal and built by folks who love what they do.” Away from the everyday intensity of the metros and away from the heavily trodden paths of established businesses, their's is certainly a road less traveled.<br><br>CinnamonTeal is a publisher of books. They serve new authors in a way that the big houses do not. They offer those who who like to write, the opportunity to to see themselves in print. They offer many services that would be too expensive, and some others that would be simply refused to them, from the more established publishers.  In the end , they offer every writer the chance to be read by an audience that can only be reached through the published book.<br><br>CinnamonTeal was founded by Leonard and Queenie Fernandes in March 2006. They started as dogearsetc.com, perhaps India's first on-line store for the trading of used books. The couple's experience in the US, where trading in old books is quite common,  made them want to experiment with the  idea in India.  Over time, dogearsetc.com began to include books by independent publishers who approached them as another platform to sell their books.  Serendipitously, they also came to learn that many of their customers wanted help to publish their books.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>At first, it seemed unreal that in a country that boasted of around 16,000 publishers, authors were still clamoring for publishers. On investigating, Leonard and Queenie discovered that many of the authors had indeed written books that were worth publishing. However, their manuscripts had been rejected by the mainstream publishers and the authors simply could not understand why. And therein lay the seeds for the birth of CinnamonTeal.  That duo researched the industry in more depth, and lo and behold! they learned about the economics of book publishing and the truth behind why these authors were rejected. It was simply that large publishing houses expected  a level of commercial success from each book that would be very difficult for new authors to deliver. So new authors were trapped in a vicious chicken-or-egg situation.  They would not be published unless they could guarantee a big success, which was unlikely until they were read in the first place! <br><br>This knowledge led them to conclude that authors needed a mechanism to publish their own book and to  market and sell it themselves. It was a service they would pay for and something they desired fervently. It allowed them to reach out to readers and to establish a level of success that would give them access to the big publishers later.  The rest, as they say, is history. CinnamonTeal was born in August 2007, to serve this need. Their's is a business centered about an author's needs. The author would decide the content, the design of the cover, the dimensions of the book and the way it would be marketed. Leonard and his team would assist the author with the required services and provide the needed advice.  But the author was always in charge.</p><br>Keen to understand the publishing story in India, Ekkitab caught up with Leonard with a few questions. <br></strong><br>You can find and buy all their published books here, from <a href="<?php echo $this->getUrl($this->getSearchUrl('cinnamontealstory'))?>">our Ekkitab Collection.</a><br><br>

<div class="ques"><span class="boldFont">What is the story of a book? How does a book get published?</span><br>
A book is generally the result of very hard labor by an author and is often completed over many months and sometimes years. At the end, and when the author is satisfied by her work, she submits a copy to several publishers in the hope that one of them will publish it. <br>A large publishing house receives several hundred manuscripts every day. The editorial department never really has the chance to review each one of them at the same level of detail. The upshot? Nine times out of ten, a manuscript from a new author ends up being rejected. It is a depressing statistic. but one that is true.<br></div></div>

<div class="ques"><span class="boldFont">Does rejection mean it is a bad book? </span><br>
No! In many cases, that is not true. A book may be rejected because a publisher isn't interested in the genre of the book or that the reviewer ignored its intrinsic merit, in the hurry of getting the job done. If you are one of the lucky few whose manuscript gets accepted, the next steps fall in place quite rapidly. The publisher immediately sets out to edit the book, typeset the pages and design the cover of the book. Marketing requirements are established and plans set out to advertise the book when it is launched.</div></div></div>

<div class="ques"><span class="boldFont">How much money is there really in book publishing? How much of a book's cover price goes to the author?</span><br>
Once the book is designed and printed, it must be sold. The supply chain for books works thus: Books are usually given to the distributors at a discount of anywhere between 45-65%. The higher discounts usually correlate to the works of lesser known authors or published by lesser known houses. The distributors then ship the book to points of sale such as bookshops, libraries, schools and colleges and even the government. Distributors and publishers both market the titles, but the publishers often push harder than the distributors. The bookshops, and other outlets, negotiate a discount of up to 40% on titles from distributors. Again, titles smaller publishers and newer authors have to be given bigger discounts to be carried in stores.<br><br>This means that the publishers are left with roughly 35% of the cost of the book. Sometimes they are paid 35% of the selling price, which is lesser than the marked price of the book. In the end, the publisher is left with a very small portion of the sale price of each book. This income must cover the editorial process, the design process and the printing and marketing costs and must also leave some for the author. It has to also pay for the support staff at the publishing houses besides other expenses that the house must bear. <br><br>Authors typically receive between 8-10% of the proceeds as royalty.<br></div></div>

<div class="ques"><span class="boldFont">What are the risks for publishers?</span><br>
There is the problem of returns. The way the book publishing industry is currently structured, outlets, especially the retail bookstores, can return unsold copies, no questions asked. This puts them under no pressure to sell a particular book. These books are returned to the distributor and from them to the publisher, resulting in unsold books that add to the cost incurred and diminish the returns on investment in that book.<br>All this means that the publishers have to make every book count. Given the pressures of making every sale count and the sheer luck on which book sales ride, it is no surprise that publishers are very selective about the book they choose to publish.</div></div></div>
<div class="clear"></div><div class="evenRow">
<div class="col1">
<div class="ques"><span class="boldFont">What does a typical book production run look like? How does a publisher decide how many copies to print?</span><br>
Books are often printed using the offset method which, like most processes, results in a lower price per unit as more units are produced. Books are typically printed in multiples of a thousand copies. The more promising books  see runs of 10,000 or more. This means that these quantities have to be sold. It also means that books which will potentially not see such sales are considered “unfit” for publishing. The book could be great and it’s appeal outstanding. But if it appeals only to a select few, and if the book cannot be sold in large numbers, it, more often than not, will not be published.</div></div>

<div class="ques"><span class="boldFont">How does self-publishing help the author? </span><br>
There are things about mainstream publishing that are not so well known. One is the issue of rights. When a publisher agrees to publish an author’s book, very often the author is asked to sign off the rights to the matter included in that book to the publisher. That is,  the publisher will have exclusive ownership of all rights to the material. In some cases, it has been found that the plot of the book and its narrative were tweaked a little to make the book more marketable. Similarly, the cover is designed keeping in mind the fact that it needs to attract eyeballs and generate sales. The author does not have much of a say on the design of the cover. Finally, there is the matter of print runs. The publisher decides how many books get printed and if there will be a reprint. <br>All these are methods that have worked for publishers before and are depended upon to work again. It works for publishers and keeps them in business. It also seems to work for the average reader – there is a variety of books to choose from and retail stores can’t seem to have enough of them to keep everyone happy.<br>The author thus practically relinquishes all control over the book, even on the amount earned off each book. This is really the prime motivation for authors to self-publish. They keep control of their baby and can continue to make changes to their strategy as they go along. It is always their decision only. </div></div></div>
<div class="clear"></div><div class="evenRow">
<div class="col1">
<div class="ques"><span class="boldFont">Who are the authors you have done business with?</span><br>
There are those who have knocked on the doors of several publishers and have had no success convincing them to publish their books and there are those who have had their books published by mainstream publishers the first time but want to do it themselves this time because of the control over the process that they enjoy<br>Poets.  Poetry is not seen as a lucrative market and hence is rarely published by mainstream publishers.<br>Authors with unconventional styles and those who wish to experiment. For example, a bilingual book that has juxtaposed the English translation alongside Bengali poems.<br>Subject specialists, professors, research students, authors of on-line magazines and NGOs. Authors in languages that have a small audience. Special purpose books like those for children with special needs. <br>Even mainstream publishers rely on print-on-demand for their back-lists with smaller demand.</div></div>
