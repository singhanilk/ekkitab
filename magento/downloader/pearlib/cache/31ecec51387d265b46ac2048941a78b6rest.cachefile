This theme delivers a more corporate look and feel with a clean and simplistic design. You can view in-action demo at http://demo.magentocommerce.com/?___store=modern_theme2

How to view the homepage as you see in the demo
There is a sample homepage template file in the extension you can access via 'template/sample/home.phtml'.
In order to assign this as your homepage, navigate to Admin -> CMS -> Manage Pages -> Homepage. Under the "content" label, enter the following:{{block type="core/template" template="sample/home.phtml"}}Save this new setting, and you should have a homepage identical to the one in the demo.
How to create the image buttons used throughout the store
With the 'modern' theme, we've deviated from the usual CSS-controlled buttons in order to give more character to the individual buttons. For those who need to edit these buttons for multi-language purposes, you can download a PSD template at http://www.magentocommerce.com/?ACT=25&fid=10115&aid=1076_zNvDLnj71nyseJr8JcSN&board_id=1
Please keep in mind that in order to replicate the buttons exactly you will need a font called 'Franklin Gothic' and 'Trade Gothic', which is not included in the package due to font/type copyright issues.";s:1:"r";a:1:{s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:10:"xlink:href";s:60:"/Chiara_PEAR_Server_REST/r/Interface_Frontend_Default_Modern";}}}
